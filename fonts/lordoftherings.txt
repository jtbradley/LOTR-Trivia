"The Ringbearer font is a replication of the font used in the logo of 
Peter Jackson's "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy. 
I tried to find the original font used in the logo for about half a year, 
however, without success. So I just tried to re-create it, using 
different logo types from international sites of LotR."
